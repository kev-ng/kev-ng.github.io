                            The Australian Government’s open data portal made available a wide range of data from different domains from air quality, population, environment data. Our challenge during GovHack 16 was to work for 48 hours to explore possibilities, ideate, and prototype a functional product based on the use of government open data. How might we make sense out of all the data and how might we create value through the available data? We focused on investigating the potentials of the real-time air quality data provided on the portal. In specific:

                    <p>Prepared with individual research, the group started by discussing and ideating potential beneficiaries of datasets that we found on the open data portal.

                    </p>
                    <p>Agreed to focus on air-quality data, we talked to people around the hackathon and to our friends to further understand the problem. We also contacted people online via social media.

                    </p>
                    <p>From that, we worked on the wireframe and validated with people whom we had interviewed. After reflecting on the initial validation, we spend the rest of the time on the functional prototype and a video to present our concept with two personas.

                    <p>As the only UXUI Designer in the team, I was responsible for running and initiating the design process.
                        I introduced to the team with tools like HMW questions, personas, concept maps, and more which had
                        helped to brainstorm and refine on the design direction. Having a structured process helped us in
                        making quick decisions as we only had 48 hours to build a functioning prototype.

                            From the user interviews that we conducted, I created personas to summarize some of the findings to an easily understandable direction to design for. I also had to wireframe and test the solution based on the design direction refined from our research. I participated in the front-end development by working with the Google Maps API and CSS styling.

                    <p>Our primary discussions with people (online and offline) have led us to two major types of citizens who would be most directly benefited from the air-quality data: asthma patients, and citizens with allergy or a weaker health. There are few key considerations that we have learned from the discussions and validations with people.

                        <strong>Be trustworthy:</strong> People explained during the interviews that trust and legitimacy of the application and its data determine whether they will revisit. Moreover, people reported that the issues with similar air-quality websites were: “not local”, ”unknown sources” and ”not legit”.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Be human:</strong> People want to know the meaning of the AQI index, not solely a number. While the data should be designed to be visually appealing and legible, the data itself should be represented in context, and in a humanized way.</p>

Why are people not using similar websites and how might we design an application which actually motivates daily usage? These were fundamental questions guided us to develop a valuable application.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Be understanding:</strong> Nearly no one expressed their habit of checking air-quality but weather on their smartphone on a daily basis. To design for the habits of users, we knew we should include other relevant and valuable data like the weather. People also showed interests in understanding why and where the pollutants came from.

                    <p>
                        We tested our concept by simply showing few screens of the concept I drew on a notepad. While it is low fidelity, it acted
                        as a quick way to demonstrate our concept during our validation sessions.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                            We went straight to the code after a reflection on the insights from the test. We decided to prototype BreatheEasy on the web as it is the core strength of the team, and because it is accessible through mobile and desktop for demonstration purposes.

                    <p>
                            By integrating 7 datasets from the government like air quality, weather, NPI emissions, and emission data, BreathEasy was purposed to inform citizens about their neighborhood’s real-time air quality and potential threats and causes of air pollution on an interactive map.


                    </p>
                    <p>
                            The concept was further developed to integrate with a portable IoT air-quality analyzer which could introduce another source for precise data visualization and aggregation to produce meaningful information — benefiting not only the users but also government departments for city improvements.

                    <h2>Exploring with design</h2>
                    <p>Finding the right balance between design and delivery is always a challenge especially in these short events. While I agree that we designers have the responsibility to empathize before we make any design decisions, short experiments could still lead us to potentials that might not have emerged in a well-resourced and planned design process.Developing a functional prototype was really beneficial in helping us and the users to understand what is (and not) valuable in the context.
                        </p>
                    <p>This project is far from perfect in its functionality and design. There are major areas that could be iterated and improved on, for example, how might we better represent the API index? What data and how should it be communicated to the user? The key value of this project, however, is not to develop a pixel-perfect app, but the learnings from the process of executing a concept and validating it in the real world.
                        </p>
