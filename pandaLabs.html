                            Partnering with the team from WWF Australia, we were asked to explore potentials for developing services for Panda Labs (and WWF Australia) in facing the crowding fundraising market and the emergence of new technologies like blockchain. Concluding from discussions with the client, the project was purposed to answer the question:

                    <p>From discovery, interpretation, ideation, prototyping, to evaluation, we have adopted the d.school design
                        thinking framework throughout the 6 weeks.</p>

                    <p>Began with secondary research and multiple interviews, we refined our focus on building a community around
                        <strong>hackathons attendees</strong>. Hackathons held are growing every year globally, these short events
                        gather some of the best ideas and skilled participants - the change agents. We see this white space of social media and hackathons
                        as a transformative potential for Panda Labs to grow.

                        value-proposition maps, brainstorming techniques, and prototypes were used to better understand the
                        design context and the needs of our potential audience.</p>
                        <p>Around 20 people participated in our interviews and prototyping testing sessions. They are our targeted users, including entrepreneurs, designers, students, software engineers, school tutors, and hackathon attendees.

                    <p>
                            As the UX/UI Designer, I was responsible for leading the design cycle by introducing different design techniques and methods to the team. I prepared and conducted user interviews and workshops. Brainstorming, storyboarding, and journey mapping sessions were some of the activities I introduced to the team to encourage divergent and convergent thinking. I created paper and digital prototypes on sketch and InVision for testing and directing our concept. As Panda Labs was a new project within WWF Australia, I was also involved in the branding and visual designs for the project.

                    <h2>Rapid Prototyping and testing</h2>
                    <p>By keeping the prototyping and testing cycle short, we got to iterate on our concept multiple rounds
                        within the limited time we had.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            Often what people said is very different than the reality. Prototypes were exceptionally helpful in letting us observe what is confusing, and what is valuable to the user. The testing and interview sessions led us to pivot the concepts quite a bit from a simple blogging website to one which shares projects, and finally to a one-stop platform for getting informed, connecting, and getting access to resources related to smart-conservation.

                    <p>Consolidating perspectives from different research, we have identified our target audience to be change makers like Entrepreneurs, Designers, Students, and software engineers, and participants of hackathons. By developing a digital platform around this community, it would help Panda Labs in establishing its digital presence for a global reach, but as well, connect a network of potential change agents to make better use of WWF’s resources.

                    <h3>News and Trends</h3>
                    <p>Our users saw the value in sharing and getting latest trends and updates from the community. The sharing of knowledge keeps the community connected, which doesn’t happen in hackathons.
                        </p>
                    <h3>Organize online and offline events</h3>
                    <p>The ability to organize and popularize online and offline events is an important feature to grow the community locally and globally. Having a station for all related events are beneficial for change agents to connect and stay informed.

                    <p>The sharing of and getting informed about projects within the network is a feature that does not currently have a unified channel for communication apart from event-based websites/blogs/slack channels. Having such a channel would open up missed opportunities (like employment, talent acquisition, investments, etc).

                    </p>
                    <h3>Access to resources</h3>
                    <p>WWF Australia has numerous tangible and intangible resources that are available for change agents. These are underutilized resources waiting to be matched with potential startups. Having a platform to broadcast these resources would bridge the gap between WWF's resources and potential smart-conservation related projects.</p>

                    <p>Approaching this project with a UX mindset introduced a set of tools and methods for the team to craft a better solution by asking the right questions and understanding the audience.
                        </p>
                    <p>We devoted our attention to the people. Design helped us to think holistically in consideration to how our designs might fit into the existing systems.

                <div class="col-10 col-md-5 offset-1 offset-md-0">
                    <p>For example, we know that our users do not want a collaboration tool because people are already used to a set of collaboration tools like Slack. Taking into account in other systems around the users allowed us to design something that is truly valuable.

                    </p>
                    <p>While we did create some high-fidelity mock-ups, the visual design of the interface is merely one of the values of a UX design process. It is important to understand that our solution is only one of the many possible directions we came up with within the 6 weeks for the specified challenge.
