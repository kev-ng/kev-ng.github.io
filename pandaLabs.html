                        a community around change-agents who wants to contribute in the smart-conservation industry. They
                        have successfully helped and connected startups to thier partner incubator for further development.

                    <p>Partnering with the team from WWF Australia, we were asked to explore potentials for developing services
                        for Panda Labs (and WWF Australia) in facing the crowding fundraising market and the emergence of
                        new technologies like block chain. Concluding from discussions with the client, the project was purposed

                    <p>From discovery, interpretation, ideation, prototyping, to evaluation, we have adopted the d.school design
                        thinking framework throughout the 6 weeks.</p>

                    <p>Began with secondary research and multiple interviews, we refined our focus on building a community around
                        <strong>hackathons attendees</strong>. Hackathons held are growing every year globally, these short events
                        gather some of the best ideas and skilled participants - the change agents. We see this white space of social media and hackathons
                        as a transformative potential for Panda Labs to grow.

                        design context and the needs of our potential audience.</p>
                        <p>Around 20 people participated in our interviews and prototyping testing sessions. They are our targeted users,
                                including entreprenuers, designers, students, software engineers, school tutors, and hackathon attendees.

                        techniques and methods to the team. I prepared and conducted user interviews and workshops. Brainstorming,
                        storyboarding, and journey mapping sessions were some of the activities I introduced to the team
                        to encourage divergent and convergent thinking. I created paper and digital protoypes on sketch and
                        InVision for testing and directing our concept. As Panda Labs was a new project within WWF Australia,
                        I was also invovled in the branding and visual designs for the project.</p>

                    <p>By keeping the prototyping and testing cycle short, we got to iterate on our concept multiple rounds
                        within the limited time we had.
                    </p>
                    <p>Often what people said is very different than the reality. Prototypes, therefore, were exceptionally
                        helpful in letting us observe what is confusing, and what is valueable to the user. The testing and
                        interview sessions led us to pivot our concept quite a bit from a simple blogging website, to one
                        which shares projects, and finally to a one-stop platform for getting informed, connecting, and getting
                        access to resoruces related to smart-conservation.

                        By developing a digital platform around this community, it would help Panda Labs in establishing
                        its digital presence for a global reach, but as well, connect a network of potential change agents
                        to make better use of WWF’s resources.

                    <p>Our users saw the value in sharing and getting latests trends and updates from the community. The sharing
                        of knowledge keeps the community connected, which doesn’t happen in hackathons. </p>

                        community locally and globally. Having a station for all related events are benifitial for change

                        have a unified channel for communication apart from event-based websites/blogs/slack channels. Having
                        such a channel would open up the missed opotunities (like employmeent, talent acqutisiotn, investments,

                        are under utilizied resources waiting to be matched with potential startups. Having a platform to
                        broadcast these resources would bridge the gap between WWF's resources and potential smart-conservation
                        related projects. </p>

                        allowed us to designing something that are truly valuable.
