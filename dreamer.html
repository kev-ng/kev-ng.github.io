                    <p>The challenge was to develop a web application for exploring contents from the  <a href="http://help.nla.gov.au/trove/using-trove/getting-to-know-us" target="_blank">Trove API</a> - an API which gathers library and museum archives like historical images, books, newspapers, artworks and more. It was specified that we are not designing a search engine, or a new user interface for the Trove API, but rather, to design for a purpose with the use of Trove data. A short questionnaire with people around the school and an exploration of the content on our own led us to understand that the content is mostly historical, unrelated, different, and somewhat boring to people. From that we framed the challenge as a mission to create memorable interaction with the boring contents and dull experience with Trove, in specific:

                    <p>
                            As the project lead, I initiated the project by drafting and maintaining key tasks, deadlines, and responsibilities each week on a shared google sheet. I ran report back sessions and facilitated design/coding sprints. In making important decisions, I led discussions to reach agreement among the team. I organized several after class design/coding sprints with specific goals, design activities, and report sessions to make sure the team is meeting the milestones collaboratively and on schedule. Apart from the ideation and research tasks that everyone participated in, I was majorly responsible for the front-end development and interaction design for the project. I did also contribute to solving some major back-end issues as I have experience working with databases and PHP.

                    <h2>Designing for the content </h2>
                    <p>Discovering types of content on Trove was our first step of research. I created a table of content types
                        that I found most interesting for later reference. We then began understanding our audience by observing
                        people’s frustrations interacting with trove. We also interviewed people about the most memorable
                        expereinces they had with a website. Few of those were most inspirational for our design direction,
                        for instance, <a href="http://i-remember.fr/en" target="_blank">I-remeber</a> and <a href="https://my.pottermore.com/patronus" target="_blank">Discover your Patronus by Pottermore</a>. With the magical experience we aim to design for, the movie Inside Out and Harry Potter are inspirations in which we took references to. Academic HCI research related to creating a magical experience was also referenced when designing the platform.

                    <p>Individually we each created storyboards to refine our best concepts to pitch to the team.

                    <p>There are a variety of applications for dream sharing, dream documenting, and dream exploring. In film
                        and literature, dreams are often presented in very “magical” ways, whereas most dream-related web
                        applications (e.g. <a href="https://www.dreamscloud.com/" target="_blank">Dreams Cloud</a> and <a href="http://www.inmydream.net/" target="_blank">In My Dream</a>) present dreams in rather unimaginative ways. These
                        websites look more like pinboards and forums. While they may make dream sharing and dream searching
                        easy, the application is not very sucessful in capturing the emotive and atmospheric qualities of
                        dreams.</p>

We documented users responses with a range of methods including observation notes, video, questionnaire, and open-ended discussions.

                    </p>
                    <p>We made various adjustments to the concept and on specific interactions. For instance, some users tried to click, instead of drag the orbs on the interface. As a result, we reconsidered the visual and textual prompts that users get on landing to better afford a dragging interaction.

Storyboards for users with different motivations (i.e. share a dream v.s. explore dreams) were created for us to better understand the interactions that could occur for different people.

                    <p>
                            We ran a cognitive walkthrough to examine the usability of each action for our concept. In each task that we wanted to test, the entire team went through each of these three questions for every action needed to carry out the task:



                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Will correct action be sufficiently evident to the user?
                        </li>
                        <li>Will user notice that correct action is available?
                        </li>
                        <li>Will user associate and interpret system response?
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                            It was apparent that there is insufficient affordance on the current interface for users to perform the correct actions. As an outcome, we had to introduce visual and textual cues of available actions.

                            This project reminded us of the importance of  "form follows function". A web application does not always have to be designed with a dashboard or a card-based interface, nor does it have to align with the material design system.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                            As a designer, it is important to understand that interaction is a mean for users to access content or a function. We design interaction to echo and communicate.
                        

                    </p>
                    <p>In this project, our goal was to create an impactful and relatable way for creatives to interact with artworks on trove. To achieve this, we had to go beyond a card-based interface and reimagine ways to communicate the emotive and atmospheric qualities of a dream.
                        </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-10 offset-1 offset-md-0 col-md-5">
                    <p>Another learning from this project was the fact that experiences can never be designed, but designed for. User experience is always subjective, it is an internal perception of a user based on external stimulus. We can only craft our design in a way which best (based on our understanding of the people) evoke such an experience.

As designers, we have to acknowledge the different perspectives and to strive for a balance in our design decisions.
